# Introduction

This project is a learning experience working with SwiftUI on Xcode. I learned how to navigate the Xcode environment and use its features to get started on coding in Swift. From relying on Google and GenAI to learn Swift's syntax, I understood that concepts of classes and functions, inheritance, and encapsulation are similarly shared across programming languages.

I implemented several features according to the suggestions of the Pokemon Development Guide. I applied the trail-of-breadcrumbs technique to figure out what happened behind the displayed UI and fix things that did not match up.

While creating new changes to the project, I committed and pushed modifications to this main repository. Initially, I ran into issues that removed most of my code, so I had to start over. Thus, the painful takeaway is to make frequent commits and stage changes to prevent losing hours of code.
