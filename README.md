# Pokémon App Development Guide

Welcome to the Pokémon App Development Guide! This project is designed to help you understand how to interact with the Pokémon API using SwiftUI and REST API techniques. Below, you'll find detailed instructions on how the app is structured and suggestions for further development.

## Project Overview

This iOS app fetches and displays a list of Pokémon using the Pokémon API. It's built using SwiftUI and demonstrates how to perform network requests, handle JSON data, and update the UI dynamically with fetched data.

## Features

- **Fetch Data**: The app retrieves a list of Pokémon from the Pokémon API.
- **Display Data**: Displays the names of Pokémon in a simple, scrollable list.
- **Expandable**: The basic setup allows for easy expansion and inclusion of additional API endpoints.

## How It Works

### APIManager

The `APIManager` class is central to handling API requests. It uses `URLSession` to make network calls and parses JSON responses to extract Pokémon data. This class can be extended to include more complex API interactions, such as fetching detailed Pokémon data or pagination handling.

### Models

- `PokemonListResponse`: A model to decode the list of Pokémon from the API.
- `PokemonEntry`: Represents a single Pokémon entry, including its name and URL.

### ContentView

The `ContentView` displays the list of Pokémon. It observes changes in the `APIManager` to update the UI when new data is fetched.

## Expanding Your App

Here are a few ideas on how you can expand the app:

1. **Detailed Pokémon View**: Create a new view that shows detailed information about each Pokémon when tapped.
2. **Search Functionality**: Add a search bar to allow users to search for Pokémon by name.
3. **Pagination**: Implement pagination to load more Pokémon as the user scrolls.

## Conclusion

This project provides a basic framework for building an iOS app with SwiftUI that interacts with a REST API. It's designed to be a starting point for students to learn and create more complex applications using similar techniques. The pokeAPI has numerous endpoints you could integrate into your app so be creative it make it your own.
